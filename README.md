## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, we're interested in using a text dataset about disasters and predicting what type of disaster this is, so we can help by sending groceries or other kind of help.

The main idea of this prediction model is to help as many people as possible by sending that help directed by our model.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 python files that do the entire pipeline from ETL to final machine learning model.

We also have a python file that makes the entire web application so that the machine learning model created can actually be used in practice.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The final web application for this job is available at the following link: https://share.streamlit.io/vitorbeltrao/nlp-disaster-response/app.py
